# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language? 
I think that the python programming language is more straightforward than other types of programs. At first, I was a little confused on the certain variables that were used; I also felt a little overwhelmed because of how visual code is formatted and the fact that there are many different ways to code the problems in a1.py. However after spending time on ChatGPT, I have been able to get a hang of the certain syntax and functions python uses that are different from java. 

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Some similarities between Python and Javascript include the use of iteration loops such as for and while loops. Both languages also use functions, however, instead of curly brackets in javascript, python uses the colon to define a function. While they both use comparision conditions, python allows the programmer to use the actual word (or/and), while in javascript you would have to use symbols to represent them (!,&&,||)



3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I have learned how to use different syntax and commands when solving a problem. I have also learned how to create a variety of different solutions to a problem.
